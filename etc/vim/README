========================================
Yannick LM's vim configuration files.
========================================


Setup:
======

You'll need a fairly recent version of vim for everything to work.

You'll need to have exuberant-ctags installed to stop having vimrc
complaining at start up.


Random notes:
============


I'll try to keep the correct file system hierarchy for vim scripts,
so the vimrc itself is  quite small

The various plugins are versionned as they were when I downloaded them,
and some of them are patched, so do not expect to have the latest
version of every plugins.


If you wish to change settings for a particular language, please use
vim/ftplugin/<language>.vim, NOT vimrc.

Non-standard behavior:

 - trailing white spaces are removed when saving
 - virtualedit in "block" mode

mappings in normal mode
 - ,cd: to go the directory containing the current buffer
 (mimic default emacs' behavior)
 - alt-<UP>  : go to the previous buffer
 - alt-<DOWN>: go to the next buffer
 - K : open manpage for work under cursor.
 (you can use :Man too)
