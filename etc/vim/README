Yannick LM's vim configuration files.



Hi there ;)

Just a few notes about what you're about to find here.

SETUP:
-----

Best thing to do is to untar the archive in ~/.config,
and add a symlink ~/.vim -> ~/.config/vim,
~/.vimrc -> ~/.config/vimrc
(After having carefully backuped your own settings!)


FILES:
----

vimrc       : some of setting you'll hopefully find useful.

REAMDE      : this file ;)
colors      : some colorscheme I like (although I'm color-blind ...)
doc
ftplugin
plugin
skeletons  : use this to put your templates. (see vimrc on how to use it)
spell
syntax     : better syntax file for python, and a asccidoc syntax file
tags

./ftplugin: : Options put here because there are conflicts with vimrc, or
just because they are too specific


./plugin   :  A bunch of plugins that I found useful. Careful! Some of them may
not be up-to-date, and a few of them are patched ;). However some are necessary
for this configuration to work properly. (vimbuddy and imaps)


tags/python : This goes with the "set tags+=" in ftplugin/python. It contains
python tags from a regular Pthon2.6 distribution.

.gitignore  : Yes, all of this is versionned with git.

Beware, vimrc contains auto-removing of trailing whitespaces,
which could be harmful ...
