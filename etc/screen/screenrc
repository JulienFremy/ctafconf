# explanation about color codes:
#
# sorendition <attribute> <color>
# sorendition ab cd  //  a,c=bg  b,d=fg
#
#  ab             c&d       c&d
#  00 normal       0 black   4 blue
#  1- invert       1 red     5 magenta
#  25 bright       2 green   6 cyan
#  3- 1+2          3 brown   7 silver
#
# * attributes are cumulative, so a=3 is invert+bright
# * colors use the same codes for bg & fg colors,
#   so cd=22 all you get is green, text unreadable
#
# examples:
#  00 02 - black bg (0), green fg (2), no attributes (00)
#  20 30 - brown bg (3), black fg (0), bright bg (2) -> turns yellow
#  35 74 - silver bg (7), blue fg (4), invert, bright bg (3), bright fg (5)
#
#
# Coloring:
#sorendition 10 49 # Blue on White
#sorendition 05 46 # Cyan on Blue
#sorendition 05 42 # Green on Blue
#sorendition  05 70
sorendition  00 49
#sorendition  00 40

# whenever a `Power detach' was performed.
