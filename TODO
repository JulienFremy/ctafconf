CTAFCONF:
- DOCUMENTATION
- unset, unalias => unset unnecessary stuff?
- screen : fichier de conf std (3 windows), automatiquement lance?
- svn: REPOS_PATH (svnadmin create)

ENV
- visual,editor,shell => emacs else nano,else ..

SHELL
- completion de zsh (cursor like in hh)
- kbd mapping (azerty, qwerty, dvorak) (shell/X)
- test: zsh speed with compiled configuration file
- epita: zsh color
- completion for apt, apts

EMACS
- emacs: in console (backspace, beep)
- emacs: ctrl-qqch => replace the current line , with the current buffer
- tab = 2 in bash-mode

BONUS:
- put on sf.net when reaching something stable enough?
- a gnome terminal that scroll like quake3 console using one hotkey
- compiler for some configuration file (alias, env, emacs, flux, etc..)
- ct-repo/ct-ssh : use dialog/gdialog?
- use gid and uid with mount command (maybe do a ct-mount)

DRAFT:
qra query-replace-all => find all file that contain one pattern (exclude .svn), then open emacs with the result
